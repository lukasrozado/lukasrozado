## 🚀 About Me
I work with **data engineering and analytics**, designing pipelines, building structured datasets, and creating analytical models used for decision-making.  
For the last **4+ years**, I’ve also been developing a **personal predictive modeling system**, where I handle everything end-to-end: data ingestion, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, automation, and monitoring.

I enjoy solving real problems with pragmatic, clean, and reliable data solutions.

## 🔬 What I Work On (Personally)
### 📈 Long-term Predictive Modeling System (4+ years)
A large personal project focused on applying statistical modeling, simulation, and ML techniques.  
Core components include:
- Automated data ingestion & cleaning  
- Feature engineering pipelines  
- Statistical models + ML ensembles  
- Bootstrap confidence, backtesting & metric monitoring  
- Continuous experiment cycles  
- Full reproducibility + versioning  

> This project reflects my technical depth, persistence, and ability to maintain a complex system long-term.

## 💼 Professional Experience (Transfero)
I currently work as a **Data Analyst**, contributing to the company’s data infrastructure and analytics stack.

Key areas:
- **Resilient ETL pipelines** with Python (stream processing + idempotency patterns)  
- Data ingestion from multiple APIs and sources  
- **Serverless pipelines** with Azure Functions  
- Checkpointing, retries, and performance improvements  
- Data Lake → Data Warehouse transformations (PostgreSQL)  
- Structured logging and secure workflow (Key Vault, Managed Identity)

My role strengthens my foundation in **data reliability, pipeline design, and cloud-based ingestion**.
